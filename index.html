        to live in comfort and security. By adopting, you provide a loving home and save a life, making a meaningful

          <h2>Puppy Farms & Adoptions</h2>
          <p>Puppy farms are facilities where dogs are repeatedly bred for profit, often receiving inadequate care. 
             These dogs are deprived of the love, comfort, and companionship they deserve, living in cramped and unsanitary conditions. 
             Shockingly, 85% of the 450,000 puppies sold annually in Australia come from these environments. 
             To help prevent this cruelty, consider adopting from shelters instead.</p>

          <h2>Euthanasia Shelters</h2>
          <p>Every day, 264 dogs and cats are euthanised in Australia, not because they are unwell, but simply because 
             there aren’t enough homes for them. Of the dogs surrendered annually to shelters, tragically 20% of them never 
             make it out. These numbers highlight the urgent need for more people to adopt and provide these animals with 
             the loving homes they deserve.</p>
