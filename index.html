          <p>dogs are surrendered to shelters annually.</p>
          <p>Puppy farms are facilities where dogs are repeatedly bred for profit, often receiving inadequate care. These dogs are deprived of the love, comfort, and companionship they deserve, living in cramped and unsanitary conditions. Shockingly, 85% of the 450,000 puppies sold annually in Australia come from these environments. To help prevent this cruelty, consider adopting from shelters instead.</p>

          <h2>Euthanasia Information</h2>
          <p>Every day, 264 dogs and cats are euthanised in Australia, not because they are unwell, but simply because 
             there aren’t enough homes for them. Of the dogs surrendered annually to shelters, tragically 20% of them never 
             make it out. These numbers highlight the urgent need for more people to adopt and provide these animals with 
             the loving homes they deserve.</p>
          <p>The sharp reduction in numbers, particularly after 2013, is linked to stricter regulations like the Dog Regulations 2013 in Western Australia, which improved dog welfare standards. National initiatives such as the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy and changes to animal cruelty laws in NSW also contributed to better care, reducing the need for euthanasia due to behavioural and medical issues. These reforms highlight Australia’s growing focus on animal welfare.</p>

          <h2>Cost Information</h2>
          <p>By adopting a dog, you can avoid the high costs often associated with purchasing from a breeder. Many shelters take care of vaccinations, spaying, and even basic training, which helps reduce additional expenses. While owning a dog is still a financial commitment, adopting allows you to save money and, more importantly, save a life.</p>
          <p>On average, buying a dog from a breeder costs over $5,000 more than adopting from a shelter in Victoria. While adopting does come with some costs, that money goes directly to support the shelter. You can also help your local shelter by purchasing essential items like food, bowls, toys, and treats from them.</p>

        <h2>Location of Victorian Shelters</h2>
        <p>Between January and June 2023, shelters across Victoria cared for 14,178 dogs. The concentration of major rescue shelters, such as the Lost Dogs Home and the RSPCA, is primarily in central Melbourne, where they have the most capacity for dogs. These figures highlight the ongoing demand for shelter services across the state, as many dogs require homes.</p>
