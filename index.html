          <h2>Euthanasia Information</h2>
          <p>Every day, 264 dogs and cats are euthanised in Australia, not because they are unwell, but simply because 
             there aren’t enough homes for them. Of the dogs surrendered annually to shelters, tragically 20% of them never 
             make it out. These numbers highlight the urgent need for more people to adopt and provide these animals with 
             the loving homes they deserve.</p>
          <p>The sharp reduction in numbers, particularly after 2013, is linked to stricter regulations like the Dog Regulations 2013 in Western Australia, which improved dog welfare standards. National initiatives such as the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy and changes to animal cruelty laws in NSW also contributed to better care, reducing the need for euthanasia due to behavioural and medical issues. These reforms highlight Australia’s growing focus on animal welfare.</p>

          <h2>Cost Information</h2>
          <p>By adopting a dog, you can avoid the high costs often associated with purchasing from a breeder. Many shelters take care of vaccinations, spaying, and even basic training, which helps reduce additional expenses. While owning a dog is still a financial commitment, adopting allows you to save money and, more importantly, save a life.</p>
